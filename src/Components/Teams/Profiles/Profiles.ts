    bio: "Robotics has been a passion of mine for a while. I started doing robotics in 8th grade by participating in the Vex IQ challenges and graduated to Vex EDR when I reached high school. As a programmer, I am responsible for the robot's autonomous movements. To see the complex principles and mathematics in code translate to successful real world results always fascinates me. Though I am a programmer, I enjoy building as well.  The idea of creating a robot with only your intuition and hard work and then taking that robot to competitions is really appealing to me. The adrenaline rush you feel when your hours of hard work are validated by a victory at a tournament is a rush unlike any other. "

I've been programming since elementary school, and I get to use what I've learned when coding the robot's functions and autonomous paths. I like robotics because I get to work with a group of friends to build and code a complex machine that can go to competitions and compete against other teams. Even though scoring higher and making the bot more efficient is challenging, competitions are always fun and make it worth it. Aside from robotics, I love to play the drums, especially funk, Latin, and jazz."

My other hobbies include programming, and I have participated in numerous hackathons over the years. Robotics is a welcome break from pure programming because it allows me to physically handle a robot, as the design process interests me greatly as well. It is also a place of community, as I have made many good friends during my participation at Millburn Robotics, both on my team 7405K and the other teams in the organization. This has been my third year participating in competitive VEX robotics, and I have no plans to stop in the near future!"

I work a lot on the pre-season bot and spend the rest of the season scouting other teams and coaching the drive team. I also usually control visual aspects of the bot, like last year we had a lot of the bot in pink tape, and we had all our rubber bands blue. We also added an acrylic backplate that was custom laser cut, that I designed and decorated. Overall, my experience at Millburn robotics has been really fun, and I'm really going to miss it when I graduate.",
