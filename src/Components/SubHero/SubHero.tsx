            At Millburn Robotics, we strive for perfection when it comes to designing outstanding robots to compete in competitions. We strongly emphasize the importance of planning out aspects of the robots in order to have a smooth building period. Design dictates the efficiency as well as ability of the robot in terms of each seasonâ€™s challenge. It is the first step to creating a robot, and therefore the most important one when it comes to robotics.
