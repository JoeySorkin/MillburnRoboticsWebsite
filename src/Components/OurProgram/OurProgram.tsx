                We are an organization that allows students to express
                themselves with the ability to create. Millburn Robotics takes
                part in various leagues and competitions such as VEX and VEX-AI,
                allowing our teams the opportunity to compete with a robot they
                have built.

                Led by two teachers at our school, Mr. Farrell and Mr. Seibert,
                our organization is divided among multiple teams, all with the
                prefix 7405. Both Mr. Farrell and Mr. Seibert assist students in
                executing their plans and ideas. With a large group of students,
                it is important to have reliable and capable teachers to mentor
                and run the organization. Along with this, we are proudly
                sponsored by parents of robotics team members.
